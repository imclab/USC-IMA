Day 1: Introductions
A discussion of my work, how and why I use web technology, and some exciting ways other people are using web technology.
	My work
		time spent alone
		Drawing Water
		Self-portrait by a wave
		IBM Data Wall?
	Work of others
		arcade fire: http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/
		ellie goudling: http://lights.elliegoulding.com/
		Ryan Alexander: http://notlion.github.com/streetview-stereographic/
		Cut the rope: cuttherope.ie
What is html5?
	A new (simplified) standard
		<!doctype html>
		not totally supported (yes, there are older browsers out there)
		consider html5 boilerplate
	Most of the stuff in html4
		text, image, and form elements
	New html tags for multimedia
  	video
  	audio
		canvas
	New html tags for page structure
		section, article, nav, header, footer
	New ways of storing data
		Local databases
	Some implied technologies (not actually html5)
		WebGL, WebAudio
		geolocation
		newer javascript
		CSS3 (animation)

Day 2: Doing something with Javascript
Your working environment:
	A modern browser: Chrome/Firefox/Safari
	A text editor: TextMate, SublimeText2, TextWrangler, gEdit, emacs, what-have-you
	debug console: provided by your browser
javascript:
	variables and scope
		{ things exist where you create them }
	object literals
		{ associating groups of variables }
	functions
		{ objects that can take action }
	a bit of the DOM (getElementById)
		accessing objects that exist on screen
	(maybe) prototypal inheritance (Object.create)
	Resources
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript
		http://jquery.com/
Canvas: a 2d drawing API
	Drawing a circle
	Using an image instead of the circle
	(maybe) Using a video as your image source
	Animating the circle
		using mouse position
		independent motion
		collision detection with browser window or canvas edge
	(maybe) create a bookmarklet to deploy the circle on any page

Day 3 (The Hard Stuff)
WebGL
	Drawing a triangle
		Vbo: color, positions
		Glsl Program: determine how your triangle gets drawn
	Moving the triangle
		matrix translate, rotate
	A spinning cube (would be good to get this far)
	Resources:

WebAudio
	Play a sound with stereo panning (maybe spatial localization).
	Visualize listener's position and remember their position on return visits.
	Resources:
		http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/
DOM Storage: local database
	let people remember things about your project
	a personal arrangement/simulation settings

Day 4 (Making the hard stuff easier)
Three.js: 3d scenes and animation
	3d scenes, cameras, and whatnot
Bringing other web content into your canvas/three.js scene
	maybe google maps as a texture in three.js
Make a music visualizer with three.js
