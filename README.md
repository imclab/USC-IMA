##Day 2: Doing something with Javascript
Your working environment:
	A modern browser: Chrome/Firefox/Safari
	A text editor: TextMate, SublimeText2, TextWrangler, gEdit, emacs, what-have-you
	debug console: provided by your browser
javascript:
	variables and scope
		{ things exist where you create them }
	object literals
		{ associating groups of variables }
	functions
		{ objects that can take action }
	a bit of the DOM (getElementById)
		accessing objects that exist on screen
	(maybe) prototypal inheritance (Object.create)
	Resources
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript
		http://jquery.com/
Canvas: a 2d drawing API
	Drawing a circle
	Using an image instead of the circle
	(maybe) Using a video as your image source
	Animating the circle
		using mouse position
		independent motion
		collision detection with browser window or canvas edge
	(maybe) create a bookmarklet to deploy the circle on any page

##Day 3: Audio and Graphics close to the metal
WebAudio
	Play sounds with stereo panning.
	Get spectral data from audio for visualization
	Resources:
		http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/
		https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API
WebGL (maybe, might stick with canvas for visualizing this audio)
	Drawing a triangle
		Vbo: color, positions
		Glsl Program: determine how your triangle gets drawn
	Moving the triangle
		matrix translate, rotate
	Resources:

##Day 4 Making a music visualizer with 3.js
Three.js: 3d scenes and animation
	3d scenes, cameras, and whatnot
	make a grid of 3d objects (spheres, cubes, whatever)
	texture the objects
	(maybe) manipulate them with a shader
Bring back our audio player from previous week
	plug data in to the 3d scene
